# PostgreSQL Deployment for NHS Patient Monitoring System
## Technical Documentation

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design and implementation of a secure PostgreSQL deployment for a patient monitoring system within an NHS Trust. The solution deploys PostgreSQL on Kubernetes using infrastructure as code principles and implements several security best practices appropriate for healthcare data.

### 2. Solution Architecture

#### 2.1 Technical Stack
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Kustomize
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15.3
- **Secret Management**: Kubernetes Secrets (Dev), SealedSecrets (Prod)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **GitOps Implementation**: ArgoCD (recommended for implementation)


The architecture consists of:
- PostgreSQL deployment with persistent storage
- Network isolation through Kubernetes NetworkPolicies
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Separate environments for development and production

### 3. Security Implementation

#### 3.1 Network Policies
Network policies have been implemented to restrict database access to only authorized services within the patient-monitoring namespace, following the principle of least privilege. This prevents unauthorized access to the PostgreSQL database from other services or namespaces.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: postgres-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  # Limited ingress/egress rules
```

#### 3.2 RBAC Implementation
Role-Based Access Control ensures that service accounts have minimal required privileges:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: postgres-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  verbs: ["get"]
  resourceNames: ["postgres-secrets"]
```

#### 3.3 Security Context
The PostgreSQL pods run with restrictive security contexts:
- Non-root user (UID 999)
- Read-only root filesystem
- Dropped capabilities
- No privilege escalation

#### 3.4 Secrets Management
- **Development**: Standard Kubernetes secrets (not committed to Git)
- **Production**: SealedSecrets for secure storage in Git repositories

### 4. GitOps Approach

The implementation follows GitOps principles:

#### 4.1 Declarative Infrastructure
All infrastructure components are defined as code in the repository, making the desired state explicit and version-controlled.

#### 4.2 Environment Separation
Using Kustomize overlays to separate:
- **Base**: Common configuration
- **Dev Overlay**: Development-specific settings
- **Prod Overlay**: Production-specific settings with increased security

#### 4.3 CI/CD Integration
GitHub Actions workflow provides:
- Validation of Kubernetes manifests
- Security scanning with Trivy
- Automated deployment to environments
- Approval gates for production deployment

#### 4.4 Recommended GitOps Tooling
ArgoCD is recommended for implementing continuous deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: patient-monitoring-postgres-prod
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/your-org/patient-monitoring-postgres.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: overlays/prod
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: prod-patient-monitoring
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

### 5. Scaling and High Availability

#### 5.1 Current Implementation
- Production environment configured with 3 replicas
- Pod anti-affinity rules to distribute across nodes
- Resource requests and limits defined

#### 5.2 Future Enhancements
- Implement PostgreSQL clustering with leader election
- Add automated backup solution
- Implement point-in-time recovery capabilities

### 6. Monitoring and Observability

The deployment includes:
- Health and readiness probes
- Prometheus annotations for metrics scraping

Recommended extensions:
- Custom PostgreSQL metrics exporter
- Application-specific alerts for database performance
- Integration with NHS monitoring standards

### 7. Compliance Considerations

For full NHS compliance, additional measures would include:
- Data encryption at rest (could be implemented via storage class)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Regular security scanning integration
- Disaster recovery planning
- Data retention policies

### 8. Trade-offs and Considerations

#### 8.1 Simplicity vs. Features
The current implementation focuses on security fundamentals and deployment patterns rather than advanced PostgreSQL features. For a production NHS system, additional configurations for HA and backup would be essential.

#### 8.2 Security vs. Developer Experience
While strict security measures protect patient data, they may impact developer experience. The development environment maintains security while allowing easier access for legitimate development needs.

### 9. Deployment Instructions

#### 9.1 Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (1.19+)
- kubectl configured
- Kustomize installed
- SealedSecrets controller (for production)

#### 9.2 Deployment Commands

For development:
```bash
kubectl apply -k overlays/dev
```

For production:
```bash
kubectl apply -k overlays/prod
```

### 10. Conclusion

This PostgreSQL deployment meets the core requirements of the assessment by:
- Implementing Kubernetes deployment with Kustomize
- Employing multiple security best practices (NetworkPolicies, RBAC, Security Context, SealedSecrets)
- Outlining a robust GitOps approach
- Providing detailed documentation of design decisions

The solution balances security requirements essential for NHS patient data with practical implementation considerations.
